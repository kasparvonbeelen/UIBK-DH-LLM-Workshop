On Saturday Mr. W. Payne, the coroner of London, held a court of inquiry at the White Horse, Friday-street, Cheapside, respecting the recent fire which occurred upon the premises belonging to Mr. Taylor, the Blue Last Tavern, Distaff-lane. Police-constable 440 (City force) said that on the morning of Thursday last, whilst on duty in Little Distaff-lane, he experienced a strong smell of something burning. He ran up to Mr. Taylor's premises, when he found smoke issuing forth from the shutters. He immediately knocked at the door and cried \\\"Fire !\\\" but five minutes elapsed before he could arouse Mr. Taylor and his family. At length he opened his bed-room window, when some persons in the street called, to him to threw his children out of the window. Witness told him not to do so, but to make haste down stairs. The side door having been opened witness succeeded in helping Mrs. Taylor and the children out. He was then told that the potman was in the upper part of the house, and he immediately went to the stairs for the purpose of making to his bed-room, but the smoke was so dense :that he was unable to get up. He, therefore, went to the bell and rang violently, which awoke the man, and he made his escape over the roof and was taken into an adjoining house. William Maidman, sub-inspector at Watling-street brigade station, proved attending on the morning in question with his engines. The bar, taproom, and bar parlour, were then in flames. The engines were set to work, and the fire was extinguished. Mr. Taylor had told Mtn that the place was overrun with rats, and that he kept lucifer matches in the bar parlour, where no doubt the fire originated. It was quite probable that the rats might have caused the matches to ignite, either by nibbling the boxes or knocking them down. The conductor of the fire-escape, when he arrived at the fire, was so intoxicated as to be unable f\\u2022 render assistance. The Coroner was informed that he had since been dismissed. Verdict ---\\\" That the fire was accidentally caused.\\\"  RISE IN THE VALUE or LAND.\\u2014In the parish of Wensley, and hamlet of Snitterton' at a place called Oaker Hill, are about 100 acres of land (chiefly grazing), the proceeds of the rent of which are appropriated towards the poors-rate of Wensley. Nearly the whole of this land has been in the hands of the same tenants during the last 28 years, it having during that time been let for two periods of 14 years each, by auction, or ticket. The last of the periods named would have expired on Ladyday next, and on Wednesday last the whole was offered by auction in the lots occupied by the respective tenants, nine in number, and who hoped to re-occupy their respective holdings at their former rents. Some of them were, however, doomed to disappointment, as three of the lots were advanced in value by Mr. Thomas Haynes, a tenant to C. Turner, Esq., from the sums respectively hitherto paid per acre as below:\\u2014 Stephen Wall's holding los. per acre, Wm. Greatorex, lsi. per acre, and Godfrey Taylor, 124. per acre, without, however, Mr. Haynes obtaining any land ; and notwithstanding Mr. Greatorex's land was advanced by the bidding named from 2L 9s. per acre to 31. 75., he again took to his previous holding. One lot only went from the previous tenants, Messrs. Benj. and T. Marsden, to Mr. John Holmes, at an advance.\\u2014 Derbyshire Courier. A CANINE THIEF.\\u2014A gentleman, accompanied by a Newfoundland dog, lately entered the office of Messrs. Woodall and Co., bankers, Scarborough, for the purpose of transacting some business. A few minutes afterwards the dog quietly left the office, carrying in his mouth a bag containing 100 sovereigns, which he had. purloined from behind the counter; but, luckily, one of the clerks had watched the four-footed thief, and speedily recovered the stolen treasure.\\u2014Gateshead Observer, \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"decade\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 22,\n        \"min\": 1800,\n        \"max\": 1920,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1910,\n          1890\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

With reference to the second question, the Commissioners consider that the principle of the construction must equally apply to intervals in the time during which the period of residence is comprised, so that for example, a residence of three years in a parish may be united with a subsequent residence of two years in the same parish, though in the interval the party may have been out of the parish in prison for several months, or serving her Majesty as a soldier for several years ; this observation is, however, to be qualified by the supposition that the absence is one which is protected by proviso. In the application of this statute no difference exists whether the cause arise between two parishes in the same union, or in different unions. '"

On their present form there is no team in the League to touch Nelson, and barring accidents—like last season for instance— the championship looks a gift for them.\" It may be stated that in the two matches NeNOll have scored 379 runs for the loss of only L6tie wickets, giving them the wonderful average of 42 runs per wicket. On the other hand Burnley have last twenty wickets for NO runs which works out an average of 9 runs per wicket. Comment is unnecessary. . I have nothing but congratulations for the Nelson team, whose fielding, with one exception, was as near perfection as possible. Those two catches in the slips by Hartley opened the eyes of the Turfites, and reminded them of Joe Allen in his pahniest days. Then the bowling of Shacklock and Cuttell was really splendid, and at one time it seemed probable that Burnley would not reach 40. Muschainp, too, behind the wickets was all there, as \"John Henry\" found to his cost. Bower, by his score of 57 not out is very fittingly ths first winner of the increased talent money to which I referred last week, and which he very generously gave to the team. Further than that, he won the bat offered by Mr. Clegg, of Standish-street, for the highest score in the match. Amongst the interested spectators of the match were Mr. W. A. Lindsay, accompanied by his son, and the Hon. Philip Stanhope, the candidates for the Parliamentary representation of###\n",

Even if satisfactory assurances are not given to the officials of the engineers' scciety that the full rate of wages is being paid, it is not thought that that organisation ;will order their members to come out immediately. A ballot will probably be taken on the question and the conciliatory attitude adopted by the men gives grounds for hoping that the dispute will be amicably settled. In the House of Commons Parliament. yesterday Mr Field asked the Home Scretary if he would advise the Queen to release the treason felony prisoners in commemoration of the Diamond Jt.bilee, but Sir M. W. Ridley said he could add nothing to his previous replies on the subject. Ii Committee on the Workmen's Compensation Bill the discussion on Mr Chamberlain's amendment to Mr Wilson's amendment relating to the giving of notice of accidents and of claims for compensation was continued. Mr Bainbridge proposed another form of words, which Sir M. W. Ridley accepted, and after a slight modification it was adopted. Mr Ascroft then moved to amend Clause l by prohibiting contracting out, but Mr Chamberlain opposed the motion. After some debate, in the course of which Mr Burns scpported the amendment, a division was taken, and the amendment was rejected by 170 votes to .97 Mr Pickard moved to add words to provide that no scheme should be certified unless approved by three-fourths of the workmen as ascertained by ballot. Mr Chamberlain regarded the amendment as impracticable, but ocered to confer with###\n",

And that was an instance of what was one of the great hopes of England, viz., that the working-men of England were taking their affairs into their own hands, and managinv them for themselves, they have shown undoubted ability in doing so by their management of friendly and other societies to the amount of millions of money. There are kindred societies that are not financially so strong as the Manchester Unity, but they are working hard to alleviate those who are dependent upon their funds, and it is pleasing to note, how , ready the people are to render assistance when appealed to for external support. We should, therefore, thank them for what has already been done, hoping that they will always be ready to help those who cannot help themselves (our widows and orphans). The fund for this purpose has to meet all demands upon it. The sick and funds must not be interfered with to assist, and societies that have adopted that it should be compulsory upon all members to join this fund, and the majority of them in hazardous occupation, find that through accidents their widows and orphans have so increased that the funds contributed will not meet the demand to keep all payments up to the funds falls heavy on those having small wages and a large family.

The following news from Gympie, Queensland, relates to the death of Mr Joseph Hurley. formerly of Maesteg and Tondo, second son of Mr Job Hurley, Vulin Vaal, Tondu. It will be read with painful interest by h 6 old acquaintances. \"A fatal accident occurred to Mr Joseph Hurley, store-keeper, on Saturday evening (says the Gympir Miner of 15th June, 1891). At about four o'clock he wont out to deliver sonic goods on the Tamaroe road. He was driving a horse and spring cart, and being away rather longer than usual, his brother became uneasy, and about nine o'clock at night went to look for him. Being dark at the time ho had to take a lantern, and after going two miles out of town, found him lying dead on the Tamaree road. The spring cart was capsiraxl, and the horse's hind legs were over his brother's chest. There were some marks and bruises over deceased's ear and forehead, but from the way in which the body was lying it (lid not seem as if he had struggled much. Near where the cart was capsized was a sapling, and it 6 thought that one of the wheels coming in contract with it was the cause of the disaster. The###\n",

CRANE ACCIDENT AT CUMWHINTON.—An accident occurred at Cumwhinton on Thursday, by which a young man, Robert Pickering, a porter at the station, was severely injured. A large crane had been forwarded from Carlisle, for the purpose of loading some very large blocks of stone. While Mr Scott, stationmaster, and Pickering were engaged in lowering the jib, the latter accidentally lifted the clutch, throwing the whole weight of the jib on the handle, which swung round and struck Pickering on the forehead. Scott was thrown on the platform, but was no worse. Pickering was at once attended to, and subsequently removed to the Infirmary. HOLY TRINITY MEN'S MITTUAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY. Tuesday evening Mr J.

About now _ AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT Occurred to the gas reservoir or bellows of the lantern by their exploding, and this rather marred a most excellent discourse which Mr. Jones had been at considerable tremble in preparing. AS won as the loud report was heard the people made a general rush for the doors, but in spite of the fright which prevailed no one was injured. When the exact nature of the accident was ascertained, and upon being assured that nothing of a very serious character had happened, the audience resumed their seats, and the lecturer proceeded without the aid of views though Mr. John Hargraves kindly offered to piece his apparatus at the committee's disposal. Mr. Jones referred at some length to the architecture and general features, together with their style of furniture, of the ancient English castles in the middle ages, and added that such castles as Skipton were built during that period. The furniture employed in the castles at that time was, however, very meagre, and the Tudor period saw a great improvement in that respect. The lecturer deeply regretted that he was unable to show any further illustrations as the architecture of ancient times was very interesting and worthy of study, and as an instance of this remark he cited the very ancient thoroughfare known as 'The shambles\" at York,###\n",

ANOTHER STEAM BOILER EXPLOSION.—An accident occurred on Friday evening to the Antelope steamer, when opposite to Moville, on her way to Glasgow. It appeared that one of the lower plates of the boiler gave way, and the water gushing out suddenly into the hold destroyed, we regret to say, eighteen head of cattle, and slightly scalded four or fire others. No person on board received any injury, and the vessel, which was towed in this morning by the Isabella, will, we understand, be able to proceed on her voyage this evening.—Derry Sentinel of Saturday.
